# Quantum-commands-LaTeX
While TeXing my homework for my quantum class, I decided to make a bunch of new commands, Hopefully some are helpful. Would love input as well. I am sure a lot of these are probably redundant due to many packages out there, but I think this would be a fun project

Whenever using one of these new commands, be sure to put your own $ or $$.
